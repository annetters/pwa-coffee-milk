# Intro
â˜• Do you work in an office and drink coffee? Do you hate it when no one refills the milk in the fridge? Well, this is the tool for you!

It's a web app that will emit a HONK ðŸ“£ when someone reports that the milk is low. No need for an iOS or Android app, because this is a web app! 

Disclaimer: It relies on your coworkers to actually report when the milk is low. This code cannot fix any inconsiderate coworkers. You'll also need to allow permissions in your browser to allow the honk notifications.

# Notes
Last updated in 2017, but there are a lot of ideas I still want to add someday. Like honk sound customization or intergration is iOS Banner notifications.
